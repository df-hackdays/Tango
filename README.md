Problem statement 3:
How do we manage a room of learners with different experience levels and learning speeds? CLC would like to provide support for mentors and instructors to identify learners that are struggling with pace and are not comfortable publicly voicing it.


## Live-Learn

Live-Learn is a live room-based web application utilizing real-time feedback, chat, and automation to crowd-source learning while informing the instructor with up to date statistics on their session.

Using the new LiveLearnâ„¢ technique, our classroom-integrated chat-bot aims to make it easy for slow learners to become fast learners without the need of constant instructor attention.
